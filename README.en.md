    APS(Advanced Planning and Scheduling)

    1. Project Objective
       To provide an efficient tool for scientific decision-making in production scenarios.
    2. Project Features
       Represent actual planning/decision problems through constraint optimization mathematical models.
    3. Overall Solution
       Global collaboration with local optimization.
    4. Application Scenarios:
       - Planning:
         + Master Production Scheduling
         + Job Scheduling/Production Scheduling
         + Capacity Planning
         + Material Requirement Planning
       - Multi-Plan Coordination:
         + Coordination between Master Production Scheduling and Job Scheduling
         + Coordination between Master Production Scheduling and Procurement Planning
         + Coordination between Master Production Scheduling and Capacity Planning
       - Supply Chain Coordination

## Getting started
    When you first clone the repository you'll need to update the submodules:
